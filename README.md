# U.S.-Medical-Insurance-Costs

This project is based off a task from Codecademy's "Machine Learning/AI Engineering Foundations" Skill Path. The objective is to investigate a csv dataset containing the medical insurance costs of 1,338 individuals located in the United States. The dataset also includes the individual's age, sex, bmi, number of children, smoker status, and region. In this project, I explore the correlations between these components and insurance charges.
